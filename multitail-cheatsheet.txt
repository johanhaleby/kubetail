 *** selecting files to follow ***
-i x             the following parameter is a filename (in case it starts with a dash)
-I x             like -i only this one merges this logfile into the previous window
-q x z           check every x seconds for new files by search criteria z, create a new window for those
-qs x y z        check every x seconds for new files by search criteria z, create a new window for those, use color scheme y
-Q x z           check every x seconds for new files by search criteria z, put them all in the same window (using subwindows)
-Qs x y z        check every x seconds for new files by search criteria z, put them all in the same window (using subwindows), use color scheme y
-iw file i       check every 'i' seconds if 'file' appeared in the filesystem
--new-only       (for -q/-Q) only create windows for files created after multitail was started, existing files are ignored
-f               follow the following filename, not the descriptor (e.g. when logrotate archives logfiles)
--follow-all     see -f: for all files after this switch
--retry          keep trying to open the following file until it is accessible

 *** selecting command output to follow ***
-l x             parameter is a command to be executed
-L x             see -l but merge the output to a previously created window

You can have multiple regular expressions per file/command. Be warned: if
you define multiple and one of them is specified with '-E' (=for every
following file), _all_ of the current regular expressions are for all
following files!
